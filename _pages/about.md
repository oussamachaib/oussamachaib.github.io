I am a PhD student at the Hopkinson Laboratory, University of Cambridge, where I am currently undertaking research in experimental combustion under the supervision of Prof. Simone Hochgreb. My research investigates the interaction between turbulence and thermo-diffusive instabilities in premixed hydrogen flames. My work involves a combination of experiments, data processing, and modelling.

In the past, I was an R&D Engineer at Prysmian Group where I worked on EU-CPR assessment of energy cables subject to fires. Prior to that, I completed my master's thesis at Air Liquide R&D where I investigated stabilisation mechanisms of oxy-methane flames in a dual-swirl combustor. As a graduate student, I assisted Dr. Laurent Zimmer in the development of laser diagnostics for in-situ temperature and species measurements in laminar flames, and the experimental investigation of spray dual-fuel flame dynamics.

I hold a MSc in Aerospace Engineering from CentraleSup√©lec, France and a BSc in Engineering from Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco.
