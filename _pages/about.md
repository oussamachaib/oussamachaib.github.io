I am a PhD student at the Hopkinson Laboratory, University of Cambridge, where I am currently undertaking research in experimental combustion under the supervision of Professor Simone Hochgreb. My research investigates the interaction between turbulence and thermo-diffusive instabilities in premixed hydrogen flames. My work involves a combination of experiments, data processing, and modelling.

In the past, I was an R&D Engineer at Prysmian Group where I worked on EU-CPR assessment of energy cables subject to fire until the start of my PhD in 2021. Prior to that, I completed my master's thesis in 2020 at Air Liquide R&D where I investigated stabilisation mechanisms of oxy-methane flames in a dual-swirl combustor. As a graduate student, I assisted Dr. Laurent Zimmer (CNRS/CentraleSupélec) in the development of laser diagnostics for in-situ temperature and species measurements in laminar flames (2018-2019), and the experimental investigation of spray dual-fuel flame dynamics (2019-2020).

I hold a MSc in Aerospace Engineering from CentraleSupélec, France (2020) and a BSc in Engineering from Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco (2018).
